      // react-native-svg ships a real, DOM-based web implementation
      // (lib/module/elements.web.js's WebShape class) specifically so it
      // doesn't need the native Fabric bridge at all on web — but its
      // package.json "module"/"main" fields point at the extensionless
      // native entry (lib/module/index.js -> ReactNativeSVG.js -> ./fabric),
      // and Vite's dep-optimizer resolves that exact literal path rather
      // than retrying it against the `.web.js`-first `extensions` list
      // below. Left alone, that pulls in Fabric's codegenNativeComponent
      // native-component files, which encode colors/enums as native-only
      // values (processColor ints, enum ints) that don't mean anything as
      // DOM SVG attributes — every shape rendered empty/invisible with
      // console warnings like `stroke="[object Object]"`.
      //
      // Aliased straight to elements.web.js (just the shape components:
      // Svg/Path/Circle/Line/Rect/...), not the package's own
      // ReactNativeSVG.web.js barrel — that barrel also re-exports
      // SvgUri/SvgXml's remote-fetch helpers, which pull in a `buffer`
      // polyfill that doesn't resolve cleanly under Vite and crashes the
      // whole page. Nothing this app renders (DataPointChart, Icon) needs
      // those, only plain shape primitives.

      // elsewhere still doing a deep import like
