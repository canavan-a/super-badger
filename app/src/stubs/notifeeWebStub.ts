// Stand-in for @notifee/react-native on the web build. Real notifee is a
// native-only module (its CJS internals `require()` a bare RN path that
// doesn't exist under react-native-web, which crashes Vite's dev-server
// dependency prescan the moment anything on the page even dynamically
// imports it — confirmed live: `run-app-web` failed outright with
// "Could not read from file: .../react-native-web/Libraries/vendor/emitter/
// EventEmitter" the moment BackgroundMonitorService.ts became reachable via
// import(), even though that import only ever executes behind a
// Platform.OS === 'android' guard that's never true in a browser).
//
// Every call site that touches notifee is Android-only and dynamically
// imported (see App.tsx, SettingsScreen.tsx, BackgroundMonitorService.ts),
// so on web this module is aliased in (see vite.config.ts) purely so Vite
// never has to resolve or parse the real package at all — its exports here
// are never actually invoked.
